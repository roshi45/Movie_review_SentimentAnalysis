# Movie Sentiment Analysis Application 🎬

This is a simple web application that performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model (Logistic Regression) to predict whether the sentiment of a given movie review is positive or negative.

**Features ✨**

->Submit a movie review and get a sentiment prediction (positive or negative).

->Built with Flask for the backend.

->Model is trained using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF vectorization.

->Easy deployment using Render.

**Demo 🚀**

A live version of the web application is available at: https://movie-review-sentimentanalysis.onrender.com

**Installation and Setup Instructions 🛠️**

->Clone the repository:

->Navigate to the project directory:

->Install the dependencies:

->Run the Flask app locally:

**Deployment 🖥️**

To deploy the app on Render, follow these steps:


->Ensure that you have a requirements.txt file with all the dependencies (including Gunicorn for production).

->Create a Procfile with the following content:web: gunicorn app:app

->Push the repository to GitHub and connect it to Render. Render will automatically detect and build the project.

->Set the Build Command to:pip install -r requirements.txt

->Set the Start Command to:gunicorn app:app

**Model Details 🧠**

The sentiment analysis model is a Logistic Regression classifier trained on a dataset of movie reviews. The model takes in a review, transforms it using a TF-IDF Vectorizer, and predicts whether the review has a positive or negative sentiment.


Preprocessing:Text data is preprocessed using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).


Model:Logistic Regression model trained on labeled movie reviews.
